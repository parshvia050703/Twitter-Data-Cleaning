Twitter Data Cleaning 🐦🧹

This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing raw Twitter data to prepare it for sentiment analysis, machine learning models, or other downstream data science tasks.
It demonstrates important text preprocessing steps commonly used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects to handle social media data.

📌 Project Objective:

To clean and structure messy Twitter data by removing unwanted text elements like URLs, mentions, hashtags, punctuations, and converting text into a more analyzable format.

🔍 Key Steps Performed:

Loading Twitter Data (CSV format)
Removing URLs, User Mentions, and Hashtags
Lowercasing the text
Removing punctuation and special characters
Tokenization
Stopword Removal
Lemmatization / Stemming (if applied)
Handling Missing Values
Exporting Cleaned Data for further analysis

🛠️ Technologies Used:

Python
Pandas for data manipulation
re (Regular Expressions) for text cleaning
NLTK / SpaCy (for stopword removal and tokenization, if used)
Jupyter Notebook for stepwise execution

✅ Benefits of This Cleaning Process:

Makes raw Twitter data suitable for Sentiment Analysis, Topic Modeling, or Machine Learning Models
Reduces noise and irrelevant information
Improves accuracy and quality of downstream analytics

📂 Project Structure:

Dataset - Raw Twitter data
Notebook - Step-by-step Twitter data cleaning process
Output - Cleaned dataset ready for analysis
